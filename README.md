# Visum Extension (Linkedin Finder)

I developed for you a simple extension to do that and the match are 100% accurate ! 🚀

It's my first Chrome extension, do not hesitate to report errors and suggestions. 💪

⚠️ Warning : Don't overuse this tool. It's using your personnal API token binding your Outlook and LinkedIn account. If you're spamming the LinkedIn API servers, your LinkedIn account may be restricted. So I recommend about a hundred uses per day maximum. Or do it with a second LinkedIn account.

ℹ️ Fact : You should have more matchs with personnal email than profesionnal email since people are registering on LinkedIn with their personnal email.

🚨 Last thing : This extension is in alpha version. Check sometimes for new versions on my Github repo to be sure to have the last version while waiting to have the extension approved on the Chrome store.
